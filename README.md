Opencv Tutuorials
  1. Car Detection: This program detect car using haar cascade method and also count traffic on road. In this program, I made a cascade.xml file using car data (in pos and neg file). "pos" file contain positive images, and "neg" file contains negative images. (NOTE: if you download this file, please change "neg" file name to "neg2" else edit bg.txt file yourself)
  2. Face detection: This program detects face and eye using haar cascade method. In this program I use already made cascade file given by opencv.
